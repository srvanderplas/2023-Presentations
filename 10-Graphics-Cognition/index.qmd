# Cognitive Psychology Primer

![](descartes-perception-timeline.svg){width="100%" fig-alt="A sketch from Descartes showing a stimulus, eyes, optic nerve, and higher level brain regions artistically. External information is contained in a box labeled 'Stimulus' on the right side of the image. The eyes and optic nerves are contained in a box labeled 'Perception' in the middle. Finally, the higher-level brain regions are contained in a box labeled 'Cognition'. An arrow at the bottom of the image labeled Time moves from right to left."}

## Attention

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Focused vs. Divided attention

    -   Divided = multiple input streams must be processed (e.g. driving a car)

    -   Focused = single input stream

-   Attention shifts with gaze systematically throughout a visual stimulus

-   Information which is extraneous to the task may not be stored or remembered

### Introspection

As you look at the chart I'm about to show you, what do you focus on first? second? third?

Mentally record how you read in the chart and what you're looking at over time.

Most of the time, we are concerned with ***attentive*** perception. Some factors are processed ***preattentively*** (without conscious attention), but for everything else, introspection is a valid observational method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introspection

```{r, echo = F, message = F}
# Generate some sort of plot
library(palmerpenguins)
data("penguins")
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() + ylab("Flipper Length (mm)") + xlab("Bill Length (mm)") + scale_color_manual("Penguin\nSpecies", values = c("#ff7400", "#c05ccb", "#056e76")) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Penguin Flipper Length and Bill Length by Species")
```

## Memory

### Long Term Memory

![Long Term Memory Information Retrieval](LTM.png){width="100%"}

-   unlimited storage capacity (theoretically)
-   maintained for long periods
-   two types:
    -   declarative/explicit - you can consciously evoke this
    -   non-declarative/implicit - procedural memories, such as 'how to ride a bike'

## Memory

### Short Term Memory

-   Not a term used any more. Replaced by "Working Memory"

## Memory

### Working Memory

[![Image from https://www.simplypsychology.org/working-memory.html](Working-Memory-Sketch.png)](https://www.simplypsychology.org/working-memory.html)

-   Proposed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974)
-   Limited capacity
-   Components are thought to be relatively independent of each other

# Application to Charts

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](02-grouping.svg){fig-alt="A scatterplot with points, an x-axis label, a y-axis label, and a title that says 'Title with context'. There is a main set of points surrounded by a gray region that contains the points, indicating that these points are part of a group. There is a second group of 3 points surrounded by an orange dot that appear to be completely separate from the main group." width="100%"}
:::

## Integration with Domain Knowledge

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Begin to assign meaning to the relationship between the data and the chart labels/titles

-   Retrieve knowledge from long term memory and make that available in working memory
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](03-integration-knowledge.svg){fig-alt="A scatterplot with points, an x-axis label, a y-axis label, and a title that says 'Title with context'. The titles are highlighted and arrows are drawn between them. A text label of 'integration with domain knowledge' is shown between the arrows and titles overtop the data." width="100%"}
:::

## Integration with Domain Knowledge

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Domain knowledge includes:

-   How graphs are usually structured (e.g. y-axis increases from bottom to top)

-   Conventions for use of filled vs. empty space

-   Knowledge of relationships, events, etc. that might be impactful

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Assign meaning to relationships

-   Fit visual statistics

-   Look for things that do and don't fit a rough working hypothesis about the data

A red band around the line is labeled visual search, and an arrow points to the dotted line, which is labeled estimation. A yellow line points to the corresponding points around the dotted line, labeled 'calculation', and a purple line labeled 'inference' points to a region on the y-axis that has a corresponding confidence interval." width="100%"}

# Decision Making with Graphics

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = species)) + scale_fill_manual("Penguin\nSpecies", values = c("#ff7400", "#c05ccb", "#056e76")) + xlab("Species") + ylab("# Penguins Measured") + ggtitle("Frequency of Penguins by Species") + theme_bw()
```

What is the average number of Adelie and Chinstrap penguins measured?

What steps do you go through to calculate this average?

## General Process

![](padilla-vis-comprehension.png){width="100%"}

From Padilla et al (2018), an adaptation of Pinker (1990)

## Adding in Working Memory

![](padilla-vis-decision-making.png)

From Padilla et al (2018)

## Fast and Slow Decisions

![](padilla-fast-slow.png){width="80%"}

From Padilla et al (2018)

## Fast Decisions

Visual heuristics replace calculations, requiring very little working memory

![](padilla-fast-alone.png)

## Slow Decisions

Working memory required for each estimation and calculation step

![](padilla-slow-alone.png)

## Cross-domain Findings

Major takeaways from different experiments across domains and application areas:

1.  Visualizations direct viewers bottom-up attention, which can both help and hinder decision making

2.  The visual encoding technique gives rise to visuospatial biases

3.  Visualizations that have greater *cognitive fit* produce faster and more effective decisions

4.  Knowledge-driven processes can interact with the effects of the encoding technique.

## Directing bottom-up attention

![From Padilla et al. (2018)](padilla-graphics-salience.png)

## Directing bottom-up attention

Attention focused on the pictogram instead of the base rate, leading to decisions that are suboptimal.

![From Padilla et al. (2018)](padilla-graphics-salience2.png)

## Directing bottom-up attention

If a path intersects with a point of interest, resulting decisions tend to be biased.

![From Padilla et al. (2018)](padilla-graphics-interest.png)

## Visual-spatial Biases

![From Padilla et al. (2018), rearranged to fit on slides](padilla-eye-tracking.png)

Biases:

-   Anchoring

-   Anecdotal evidence

-   Containment - what is in the container is different from what is outside the container. Ex: Binning continuous data

-   Deterministic construal - what is shown is deterministic instead of probabilistic

-   Quality bias - high quality image = high quality science

## Cognitive Fit

If there is a mismatch between the visualization type and the decision making component, working memory must be used to compensate

## Knowledge-Driven Processing

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Instructions/training (short term knowledge)

-   Individual differences (e.g. math skills, background knowledge, interests)

-   Knowledge can be used to overcome e.g. familiarity bias (preference for familiar but ineffective visualizations)

-   Subject-matter expertise
